"""Regression tests for connector-spec field naming.

Background — the bug this guards against:

The renderer renders a connector's form straight from its JSON spec.
Field names in the spec become the keys of the credentials map sent
to ``POST /datasources``. That handler validates against anton's
built-in engine registry (``anton/core/datasources/datasources.md``),
which declares the *canonical* field names for each engine.

When the two diverge — e.g. cowork's ``mysql.json`` had a field named
``username`` while anton's MySQL engine_def expects ``user`` — the
validation either rejects the save (missing required ``user``) or,
worse, the field is silently dropped on the legacy save path and the
resulting vault row has no ``DS_..._USER`` env var to inject. Either
way, the connection is unusable.

This test enforces the convention that DB-pattern connectors use
anton's canonical names. A method is treated as "DB-pattern" when it
declares a ``host`` field (databases are addressed by host:port,
SaaS APIs are not). For those methods, common aliases like
``username``/``pwd``/``db``/``hostname`` are rejected in favor of
the canonical ``user``/``password``/``database``/``host``.

Run with::

    python3 -m pytest tests/test_connector_field_names.py -v
