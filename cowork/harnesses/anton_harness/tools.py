"""Cowork-side tool wrappers.

Anton's stock tools (PUBLISH_TOOL, CONNECT_DATASOURCE_TOOL, …) are
written for the CLI: they assume a Rich Console attached to a TTY,
they pop the system browser, and they hold the user's gaze with
animated spinners. None of that works inside the FastAPI process the
desktop app spawns.

We build cowork-flavoured wrappers that share the LLM-facing schema
(name / description / input_schema) so the model uses them
identically, but whose handlers do the actual work in a way that
makes sense for a server process: no console.print, no Live spinner,
no webbrowser.open. Status flows back to the desktop UI through the
normal SSE event stream and the response string the LLM renders.

Right now we only override PUBLISH_TOOL — the only one users have hit.
Add more here as needed (CONNECT_DATASOURCE_TOOL is the next likely
candidate; same pattern).

    "spec the in-app Connector Picker uses — pass it to `request_credentials` "
    "VERBATIM (only tweak `selected_method` if the user has clearly signalled a "
    "preference, or `subtitle` to match the conversation context). Registry specs "
    "ship with `methods[]`, OAuth blocks (`submit_action: 'oauth_launch'` + "
    "`oauth: {...}`), `how_to` markdown, and `help_url` already filled in — do "
    "not strip those, do not paraphrase them. ALSO copy `_connector_id` (the "
    "lookup tool returns it) onto the form spec so submissions go to the "
    "registry-aware save endpoint.\n"
    "2. ONLY when `lookup_connector` returns no match, handcraft the spec. The "
    "schema documents OAuth, `how_to`, and `help_url` fields — use them when you "
    "know the auth shape (e.g. an OAuth provider). Better to write a good "
    "registry-grade spec than a bare username/password prompt.\n"
    "3. Call `request_credentials` with the (registry or handcrafted) spec the "
    "FIRST time. Include the returned markdown block VERBATIM (with blank lines "
    "around the fence) so the form renders in the side panel.\n"
    # "4. Wait for the user's submission. The follow-up message has a `submission_id` "

    # "browser flow itself — you'll just receive the submission with the refresh "
    # "token already in the vault.\n"
    # "5. Call `fetch_submission(submission_id)` to retrieve the staged values. Test "
    # "the connection (`connect_datasource` or a scratchpad probe).\n"
    # "6. ON FAILURE — DO NOT re-emit the full form. Use `update_form` (which "
    # "returns a `data-vault-form-patch` block) to attach an `error` to the failing "
    # "field and tweak `subtitle` / `form_warning` if useful. The user's existing "
    # "inputs stay in the panel; only the changed bits update. NEVER include `value` "
    # "fields in a patch or full re-emit — that would echo credentials into chat "

    # "7. On success, summarize what you connected and stop. Do NOT call "

    # "form is up. Reserve `request_credentials` for first emission and for fully "
    # "switching to a different connector.\n"
    "- The chat-emitted form and the picker-emitted form must FEEL identical to "
