"""The filesystem root for all cowork state.

Every piece of cowork state — the SQLite database, uploaded files, projects,
skills, memory, streams, the connector vault, the master key, the ``.env`` —
lives under a single data root. Pointing that root elsewhere isolates an
entire install: preview/stable desktop builds set ``COWORK_HOME`` to
``~/.cowork-<kind>`` so their state never collides with a user's production
``~/.cowork`` (ENG-324). Production leaves it unset and gets ``~/.cowork``.

Every default path in the codebase MUST derive from :func:`cowork_home` (via
the settings classes or directly) — a path that hardcodes ``~/.cowork`` would
silently leak across builds and defeat the isolation.
